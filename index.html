                <p>My expertise lies on building web applications' foundations with Python and the Django framework. Everything behind the scenes operates seamlessly, effectively, and securely thanks to my back-end knowledge. I use my Python mastery combined

                <p>
                    Since building dynamic and adaptable online apps in today's linked world requires API connectivity, my area of expertise is integrating third-party APIs into websites and web apps to increase their functionality and provide seamless user and businessexperiences.
